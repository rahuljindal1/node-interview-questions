## 1. What are event emiiters?

In Node.js, an event emitter is a core module that allows you to implement the publisher-subscriber pattern. It provides an implementation of the observer pattern, where objects (known as event emitters) can emit named events, and other objects (known as event listeners or subscribers) can listen for those events and react accordingly.

```node
const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Create an instance of EventEmitter
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Register an event listener
myEmitter.on('myEvent', (arg1, arg2) => {
  console.log('Event occurred with arguments:', arg1, arg2);
});

// Emit an event
myEmitter.emit('myEvent', 'Hello', 'World');
```
